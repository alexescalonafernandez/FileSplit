For running the file splitter without interaction uses these arguments:
The ARGUMENT column is the name of the argument. The TYPE column is the data type of the argument.
The MODE column specify in which split mode the argument is necessary, if the mode is ANY is
necessary in all the modes. The DESCRIPTION column explain the purpose of the argument.

ARGUMENT            TYPE          MODE     DESCRIPTION
--mode              BLOCK|GROUP   ANY      The splitter mode.
--filePath          string        ANY      The path of the file which will be splitted.
--chunkSize         integer       ANY      The estimated size in bytes that each thread worker will 
                                           process from the file to split.
--appendFirstLine   true|false    ANY      If its value is true, the first line of the file will
                                           be inserted as the first row of all generated files,
                                           which can be useful when processing CSV files.
--folderPath        string        ANY      The path of the folder where the generated files 
                                           will be stored.
--threadNumber      integer       ANY      The maximum number of thread workers which split the file
                                           concurrently.
--maxLines          integer       BLOCK    The maximum number of lines that the generated files can have.
--prefix            string        GROUP    The prefix that will have the name of each generated file.
--regex             regex         GROUP    A string representing a regular expression, which will be 
                                           applied to each line processed by a thread worker. It is 
                                           expected that the regular expression has a group that 
                                           represents the value by which the lines are grouped, which 
                                           will be used as part of the name of the generated file. 
--regexGroup        integer       GROUP    A number between 1 and 9 that represents the group specified
                                           in the --regex argument, which will be used to extract 
                                           segment of the line representing the value to group the lines.
                                           
Example of arguments where a CSV file is splitted using the BLOCK mode
--mode BLOCK --filePath D:\file.csv --chunkSize 1048576 --appendFirstLine true --folderPath D:\split 
--threadNumber 8 --maxLines 10000
